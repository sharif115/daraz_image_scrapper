Idea Overview (Click-Based Pagination with Selenium)
Conceptual Steps:
1. Open the category page in a browser using Selenium.

2. Wait for the products to load.

3. Scrape products from the current page.

4. Find the pagination "Next" button.

5. If it's enabled (i.e., not on the last page):

Click it.

Repeat the scraping for the next page.

6. Stop when the "Next" button is disabled or no longer clickable.
